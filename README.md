# 🚀 Reddit Bot 🤖

This repository contains a Reddit bot that reads hot posts and replies to specific posts in selected subreddits using PRAW — the Python Reddit API Wrapper.

## 🛠 Features

- 🔍 **Read Hot Posts**: Fetches and prints the top 5 hot posts from the `learnpython` subreddit with more than 10 upvotes.
- 💬 **Auto Reply to Posts**: Automatically replies to posts containing the phrase "I love python" in the `pythonforengineers` subreddit with a fun message.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- A Reddit account and a registered Reddit application for OAuth credentials.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-bot.git
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install praw
```

Create a `praw.ini` file in the root directory to store Reddit API credentials:

```ini
[bot1]
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
username=YOUR_USERNAME
password=YOUR_PASSWORD
user_agent=YOUR_APP_NAME
```

## 📝 Files in This Repository

- **Read_posts.py**: Fetches the top 5 hot posts from the `learnpython` subreddit and displays details (title, text, and score) of posts with more than 10 upvotes.
- **Reply_posts.py**: Scans the `pythonforengineers` subreddit for posts containing the phrase "I love python" and replies with a predefined message. Keeps track of replied posts to prevent duplicate replies.

## 🖥 Usage

1️⃣ **Read and print top posts**:

```bash
python Read_posts.py
```

2️⃣ **Reply to posts containing "I love python"**:

```bash
python Reply_posts.py
```

## 🤖 How the Bot Works

### Read_posts.py
- Connects to the `learnpython` subreddit and fetches the top 5 hot posts.
- Only prints posts with more than 10 upvotes, displaying:
  - Title
  - Text (if available)
  - Score (upvotes)

### Reply_posts.py
- Connects to the `pythonforengineers` subreddit and searches for the keyword "I love python" in post titles.
- Automatically replies with:
  
  ```
  ZIPPY SAYS: This is so cool!
  ```

- Keeps track of posts it has replied to using a `posts_replied_to.txt` file.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Your `praw.ini` file should contain correct Reddit OAuth credentials.
- The bot stores post IDs in `posts_replied_to.txt` to avoid replying multiple times to the same post.

Happy coding! 🎉
